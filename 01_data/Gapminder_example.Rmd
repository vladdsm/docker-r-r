## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(gapminder)
```

## Examples of graphs from Gapminder Package

Examples plots:

```{r echo=FALSE}
plot(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap, gapminder, subset = year == 2007, log = "x")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
if (require("dplyr")) {
gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 2007) %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarise(lifeExp = median(lifeExp))

# how many unique countries does the data contain, by continent?
gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(n_obs = n(), n_countries = n_distinct(country))

# by continent, which country experienced the sharpest 5-year drop in
# life expectancy and what was the drop?
gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent, country) %>%
  select(country, year, continent, lifeExp) %>%
  mutate(le_delta = lifeExp - lag(lifeExp)) %>%
  summarize(worst_le_delta = min(le_delta, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(min_rank(worst_le_delta) < 2) %>%
  arrange(worst_le_delta)
}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
